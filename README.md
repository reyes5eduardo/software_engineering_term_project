This is a term project that I lead for my Software Engineering class. 
The goal of the project was to provide exposure and insights as to how software engineers collaborate together to create websites, combining the frontend and backend. 
Our team set out to create an e-commerce site that users would be able use to read their favorite newspaper and magazines online.
The site provides the users a way to subscribe to newspaper and magazines and the cost of monthly subscription as well as the points they would earn for subscribing. 
Points can be redeemed towards montly subscriptions. Points can additioanlly be earned by writting a review on the newspaper or magazine. 

The files showcase the main page of the site that user would interact to see the latest articles, news and pieces from their subscribed newspaper or magazines. 
You are also able to see the newspaper and magazine list with cost and points. In addition you are able to see the the currently subscribed newspaper and magazine 
and are able to leave a review for them.
