                There he was in his basement, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, like a mirage in a
                sports-starved desert, to announce that the first pick of the 2020 league draft would
                be Louisiana State quarterback Joe Burrow, joining the Cincinnati Bengals.
                It was one of a handful of events to have summoned sports fans en masse since the
                coronavirus pandemic shut down the United States.
                <br> <br>
                As the first round proceeded on Thursday night, the N.F.L.’s calculated decision
                to move forward with a remote version of its annual made-for-television pageant did,
                indeed, fill the sports void, scratching the itch of fantasy-football types and
                taking advantage of the twist in fortune of a suddenly all-but-empty sports calendar.
                <br> <br>
                Come Saturday, however, after the selection of Mr. Irrelevant — as the 255th and last
                draft pick is known — a malaise will descend again. Along with it will come the real
                fear that the N.F.L. — and most other major sports — might not be back at all come autumn.
                <br> <br>
                Even as the league basks in the draft spotlight, its teams and officials —
                after initially insisting that the season would proceed as usual — have been
                dropping hints this week that the hurdles to returning to the field are daunting,
                particularly with fans in attendance.
                <br> <br>
                The New Orleans Saints said they would skip off-season workouts and not resume
                until training camp (whenever that is), citing the safety of its players and the
                larger community in a city considered a Covid-19 hot spot. The N.F.L. said
                no team’s facilities would open until all of them could. Given the latest surge
                in cases in the Green Bay Packers’ territory and the unpredictable patterns of
                the virus, a wide clearance for all 32 teams seems impossible to envision soon.
                <br> <br>
                The union’s medical director was more emphatic.
                <br> <br>
                “We’ll go anywhere the science takes us and nowhere the science doesn’t,”
                Dr. Thom Mayer said. “We’re going to look at everything as long as it keeps the
                patient-player, all 2,500 of them, safe.”
                <br> <br>
                Goodell acknowledged that the N.F.L. understood the warnings of the governors who want
                to go slowly in terms of reopening their states.
                <br> <br>
                “You have to be willing to be prepared to adapt,” Goodell said in an interview on ESPN.
                “You can’t expect or anticipate every move, but your job is to try to be as prepared
                as possible.”
                <br> <br>
                As the nation’s largest sports league — with $15 billion in annual revenue and
                counting — the N.F.L. is more than a bellwether, it is an enormous economic ecosystem.
                The absence of games will hurt not only the thousands of workers at team facilities
                and stadiums, but also the biggest corporations and the television networks that do
                business with the N.F.L.
                <br> <br>
                A continued shutdown of the league could also rattle the country’s already frayed psyche.
                The N.F.L. dominates the national sports conversation from Labor Day through the
                Super Bowl in February, and the league’s off-season calendar, including the three-day
                draft, is part of its drive to be a 365-day-a-year experience.
                <br> <br>
                For now, the league is milking its moment as the only show in town. The N.F.L. may
                be the largest and most popular league in the country, but this time of year the sports
                landscape is often dominated by the start of baseball, the playoffs in basketball and
                hockey, the Masters golf tournament and the Kentucky Derby. With no competition,
                the N.F.L. has seen a surge in interest as it produces fresh news about its teams
                and players.
